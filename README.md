# Autonomous Buggy Project
- - - -
## Overview:
In this group project, we were provided with a kit containing IR sensors, US sensors, motors and an arduino. With this equipment we were required to build a buggy that traverses a track (line of contrasting colour), while also avoiding obstacles. Steering and obstacle avoidance was implemented using downward facing IR sensors and a horizontal US sensor respectively.

## Challenges
This project had 3 challenges progressing in difficulty.

#### 1. Bronze tasks:
* Assemble the buggy
* Have the buggy traverse the track
* Wireless stop & start the buggy via the wireless controller
* Show telemetry data recieved from the buggy on the user GUI
* Pause for obstacles as detected by the US rangefinder

#### 2. Silver tasks:
* Implement a PID controller to allow for smooth object following
* Report current speed of buggy to user GUI

#### 3. Gold task (Optional creative challenge):
  + By reusing the PID implemented in the challenge above, as well as live IMU data, we got the buggy to balance upright on two wheels.
